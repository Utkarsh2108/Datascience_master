        "* Bagging, which stands for Bootstrap Aggregating, reduces overfitting in decision trees by generating multiple samples of the training dataset by randomly selecting instances with replacement. These samples are then used to train different decision tree models. During the training process, each tree is only exposed to a subset of the data, which helps to reduce the impact of individual noisy data points or outliers.\n",

        "* After all the trees are trained, the algorithm aggregates the predictions made by each tree to make a final prediction. By combining the predictions of multiple trees, bagging can reduce the variance of the model, which is a major cause of overfitting. This results in a more generalized model that can perform better on new, unseen data."

In fact, bagging may even increase the bias, as each model is trained on a subset of the data, potentially missing important information. In this case, other ensemble methods, such as boosting, may be more effective."
