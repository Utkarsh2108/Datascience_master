        "* When developing an SVM regression model to predict house prices based on several characteristics, the best regression metric to employ would be the mean squared error (MSE). The MSE measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual house prices, which provides a good indication of how well the model is performing in terms of accuracy. Additionally, the MSE is commonly used as a loss function in SVM regression and other machine learning algorithms, making it a standard metric to use when evaluating model performance. Other commonly used regression metrics, such as the mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squared, could also be used in this situation, but the MSE is generally the preferred metric for SVM regression."

This is because the MAE is less sensitive to outliers than the mean squared error (MSE) since it calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values rather than the squared difference. The MSE can be heavily influenced by outliers, as the squared differences can become very large, resulting in a higher overall error. The MAE, on the other hand, provides a more robust measure of error that is less affected by extreme values. Therefore, if the dataset contains a significant number of outliers, the MAE would be the more appropriate metric to use with an SVM model."

However, if we want to choose only one metric, it is generally recommended to use RMSE, as it is more interpretable than MSE. RMSE is expressed in the same units as the target variable, which makes it easier to interpret the magnitude of the error in the context of the problem domain. Therefore, in this case, RMSE would be the better metric to choose to evaluate the performance of your SVM regression model."
